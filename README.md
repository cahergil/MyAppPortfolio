# Popular Movies

The purpose of this project was to built an app, optimized for tablets, to help users discover popular and highly rated movies on the web. It displays a scrolling grid of movie trailers, launches a details screen whenever a particular movie is selected, allows users to save favorites, play trailers, and read user reviews. This app utilizes core Android user interface components and fetches movie information using themoviedb.org web API.

### Features

This app is the first and second project in Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. To develop this app I used the MVP pattern. [This](http://antonioleiva.com/mvp-android/) blog entry explains briefly what is MVP and why you should use it in your developments. 
The following is the requirements list of this app in the Android Developer Nanodegree.

1. **Popular Movies Stage 1 requirements:**
  1. Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
  2. Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
  3. The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
  4. Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
    * *original title.*
    * *movie poster image thumbnail.*
    * *a plot synopsis.* 
    * *user rating.* 
    * *release date.*
2. **Popular Movies Stage 2 requirements:**	
  1. Allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
  2. Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
  3. Allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local    movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request*.
  4. Modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
